                    Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?
                    <br>
                    No! Don't jump! I just told you! You've killed me! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! No, I'm Santa Claus! Fry, we have a crate to deliver.

                    Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!
